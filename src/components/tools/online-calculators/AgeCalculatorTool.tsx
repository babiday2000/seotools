            <p>An Age Calculator is a versatile digital tool designed to determine the precise age of an individual based on their date of birth. It provides a detailed breakdown of age in years, months, and days, offering a more accurate result than manual calculation. This tool is incredibly useful for a wide range of applications, from filling out official documents and planning age-specific events to simply satisfying personal curiosity. By automating the calculation process, it eliminates the risk of human error and provides instant, reliable results. Whether you need to know your exact age for a legal requirement or want to find out how many days you've been alive, an age calculator is the perfect solution.</p>
            <p>The primary function of an Age Calculator is to bridge the gap between two dates: the date of birth and the current date. It takes into account the complexities of the Gregorian calendar, including leap years and varying month lengths, to deliver a precise age. This makes it an indispensable tool for professionals in fields such as human resources, event planning, and education, where age verification is often required. For personal use, it can be a fun way to track milestones, celebrate birthdays, and gain a deeper appreciation for the passage of time. The calculator's user-friendly interface ensures that anyone can use it with ease, making it accessible to people of all ages and technical abilities.</p>

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>To accurately calculate age, the tool relies on a few fundamental components that work together to process the input and deliver the result. Understanding these components can help you appreciate the logic behind the calculation.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li><strong>Date of Birth (DOB):</strong> This is the primary input required from the user. The DOB serves as the starting point for the calculation, and its accuracy is crucial for obtaining a correct result. The calculator parses this date to extract the year, month, and day of birth.</li>
              <li><strong>Current Date:</strong> The calculator automatically retrieves the current date from the system it's running on. This serves as the endpoint for the age calculation. The difference between the current date and the DOB is what determines the final age.</li>
              <li><strong>Calculation Logic:</strong> The core of the calculator is its algorithm, which computes the difference between the two dates. It subtracts the birth year, month, and day from the current year, month, and day, while also accounting for calendar rules. For example, it adjusts for borrowing days from months or months from years to ensure the final age is accurate. This logic also handles leap years, which can affect the number of days in a year.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These components work in harmony to provide a seamless user experience. The user simply provides their date of birth, and the calculator handles the rest, performing the complex calculations in the background. The result is a clear and precise age, broken down into years, months, and days, giving you a comprehensive understanding of your age at any given moment.</p>

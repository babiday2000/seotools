This was a groundbreaking development in the field of statistics, as it allowed researchers to express the uncertainty associated with their estimates in a clear and intuitive way. Today, confidence intervals are a fundamental tool in statistical inference, used in fields ranging from medicine and engineering to economics and social sciences." }) })] }));

            <p>Creators primarily earn money through the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), which places ads on their videos via Google AdSense. To be eligible, a channel must have at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in the past 12 months.</p>
            <p>Revenue is not based on subscribers, but on monetized views of ads. It's important to note that this calculator only estimates ad revenue. Many creators have additional income streams like sponsorships, affiliate marketing, merchandise sales, and channel memberships, which can often surpass ad revenue.</p>

          <CardContent className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
            <p><strong>RPM (Revenue Per Mille)</strong> is the most important creator-centric metric. It represents your total revenue (from ads, YouTube Premium, memberships, etc.) for every 1,000 video views. It's the effective rate you earn from all sources combined, divided by your total views.</p>
            <p>This differs from <strong>CPM (Cost Per Mille)</strong>, which is the cost an advertiser pays for 1,000 ad impressions before YouTube takes its share. Your RPM will always be lower than the CPM because it accounts for YouTube's revenue cut (typically 45% for ads) and the fact that not every view gets an ad.</p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
            <li><strong>Audience Location:</strong> Advertisers pay a premium to reach viewers in Tier 1 countries (USA, UK, Canada, Australia) due to higher purchasing power, resulting in a much higher RPM.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Niche:</strong> Content about finance, technology, real estate, and business commands the highest ad rates because the products being advertised have high value. Entertainment, gaming, and lifestyle niches typically have lower RPMs.</li>
            <li><strong>Time of Year (Seasonality):</strong> Ad spending skyrockets in Q4 (October-December) for the holidays, significantly boosting RPMs. Conversely, Q1 (January-March) often sees the lowest rates as marketing budgets reset.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Length:</strong> Videos over 8 minutes long are eligible for mid-roll ads (ads placed in the middle of the video). This can dramatically increase the number of ad impressions and therefore the RPM for that video.</li>
            <li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Advertisers often target specific age groups and genders (e.g., 25-44 year olds with high disposable income), which can influence the value of your channel's ad inventory.</li>

            Our tool is designed to be simple and intuitive. Hereâ€™s how you can get an estimate of a channel's potential earnings:

          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li><strong>Adjust Daily Views:</strong> Use the slider to set the estimated number of daily views the channel receives. You can often find this information on social media analytics sites or by observing the channel's recent performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Set the RPM:</strong> Adjust the RPM (Revenue Per 1,000 Views) slider. This is a crucial factor that varies greatly by niche and audience location. An RPM of $2-$5 is common for entertainment channels, while finance and tech channels can have RPMs of $10-$20 or even higher.</li>
            <li><strong>Review the Estimates:</strong> The tool will instantly calculate the estimated daily, monthly, and yearly earnings based on your inputs.</li>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold">Is this calculator 100% accurate?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">No, this is an estimator tool. Actual earnings depend on a wide variety of factors that cannot be accounted for in a simple calculator, such as the specific ads shown, audience demographics, and seasonality. However, it provides a reasonable ballpark estimate.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold">Does this include other income sources?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">This calculator estimates AdSense revenue only. Top YouTubers often have multiple income streams, including sponsorships, merchandise, affiliate marketing, and channel memberships, which are not included in this calculation.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold">What's a typical RPM for a YouTube channel?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">RPMs can range from as low as $0.50 to over $20.

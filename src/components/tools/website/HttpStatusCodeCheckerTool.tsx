          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">What is an HTTP Status Code?</h2>
          <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
            <p>An HTTP status code is a three-digit number returned by a server in response to a client's request for a webpage or resource. These codes are a crucial part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and provide a quick and standardized way to understand the outcome of the request. For instance, when you type a URL into your browser, you are sending a request to a server. The server then processes this request and sends back the requested content along with an HTTP status code in the response header.</p>
            <p>These codes are essential for web developers, SEO professionals, and system administrators. They help diagnose issues, understand how search engines are interacting with a site, and ensure a smooth user experience. A successful request might return a `200 OK`, while a request for a non-existent page will result in a `404 Not Found`. By understanding these codes, you can quickly identify and resolve problems, from broken links to server errors.</p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">Factors Influencing HTTP Status Codes</h2>
          <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
            <p>Several factors can determine the HTTP status code a server returns. Understanding these can help in troubleshooting and managing a website effectively:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4">
              <li><strong>Request Validity:</strong> If the client's request is malformed or contains invalid syntax, the server will likely return a 4xx client error code, such as `400 Bad Request`.</li>
              <li><strong>Resource Availability:</strong> The most straightforward factor is whether the requested resource exists. If the URL points to a page that has been moved or deleted, the server will respond with a `301 Moved Permanently` or `404 Not Found`, respectively.</li>
              <li><strong>Server Health:</strong> The status of the server itself is a critical factor. If the server is overloaded, undergoing maintenance, or encounters an internal error, it may return a 5xx server error code, like `500 Internal Server Error` or `503 Service Unavailable`.</li>
              <li><strong>Permissions and Authentication:</strong> Access to certain resources may be restricted. If a user tries to access a page they are not authorized to view, the server will return a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` status code.</li>
              <li><strong>Redirects:</strong> If a URL has been moved, the server will issue a 3xx redirection code to guide the client to the new location. This is common practice for maintaining SEO value when changing URL structures.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">Key Components of an HTTP Status Code</h2>
          <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
            <p>HTTP status codes are categorized into five classes, distinguished by their first digit. Each class represents a different type of server response:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4">
              <li><strong>1xx (Informational):</strong> These codes indicate that the request was received and the process is continuing. They are rarely seen by the average user. Example: `100 Continue`.</li>
              <li><strong>2xx (Successful):</strong> This class of codes signifies that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted. The most common is `200 OK`.</li>
              <li><strong>3xx (Redirection):</strong> These codes indicate that further action needs to be taken by the client to complete the request, usually involving redirection to another URL. `301 Moved Permanently` is a key example for SEO.</li>
              <li><strong>4xx (Client Error):</strong> This class indicates that there was an error on the client's side, such as a malformed request or a request for a non-existent page. `404 Not Found` is the most well-known.</li>
              <li><strong>5xx (Server Error):</strong> These codes are returned when the server fails to fulfill a valid request due to an error on the server's end. `500 Internal Server Error` is a common catch-all for server-side issues.</li>
            </ul>

          <div className="mt-4 space-y-6">
            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold">Why is checking HTTP status codes important for SEO?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-1">Search engines like Google use status codes to understand the health and structure of your site. A `200 OK` tells them a page is healthy. A `301` redirect passes link equity to the new URL. On the other hand, frequent `404` errors can harm user experience and may lead to search engines crawling your site less frequently. `5xx` errors can cause pages to be de-indexed if not resolved quickly.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold">What's the difference between a 301 and a 302 redirect?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-1">A `301` redirect indicates that a page has moved permanently to a new location. This is the best practice for SEO as it transfers most of the link equity to the new URL. A `302` redirect signifies a temporary move. It's useful for A/B testing or when a page is temporarily unavailable, but it doesn't pass link equity in the same way as a 301.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold">Can a page with a 404 error still be indexed?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-1">If a page consistently returns a `404 Not Found` error, search engines will eventually remove it from their index. However, if a page that was previously live starts returning a 404, it may take some time for it to be de-indexed.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">Fun Fact</h2>
          <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
            <p>One of the most famous and quirky HTTP status codes is `418 I'm a teapot`. It was created in 1998 as an April Fools' joke and is defined in RFC 2324, the "Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol." While not a "real" status code used in practice, it's a beloved piece of internet humor and is sometimes implemented in software as an Easter egg.</p>

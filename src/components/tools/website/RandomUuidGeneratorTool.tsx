                <p>A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. It is a standard that is used in software development to create unique identifiers for objects, such as database records, files, and more.</p>
                <p>UUIDs are designed to be unique across both space and time, which means that the same UUID will not be generated twice. This makes them ideal for use in distributed systems, where it is important to have a unique identifier for each object.</p>

                <p>A UUID is a 128-bit number that is typically represented as a sequence of 32 hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens. For example, a UUID might look like this: `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`.</p>
                <p>There are several versions of UUIDs, each of which is generated in a different way. The most common version is version 4, which is generated using random numbers.</p>
